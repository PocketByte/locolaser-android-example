# LocoLaser Android Example
LocoLaser - Localozation tool for Android and iOS. See https://github.com/PocketByte/LocoLaser/ for more details.
<br>This example project shows how to use localization in Android.

##### 1 Step: Apply gradle plugin
Example uses standard way to apply custom gradle plugin.
<br>In **`build.gradle`** of the project did added maven repository and classpath:
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      // 1.1: Add maven repository
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    // 1.2: Add classpath dependency
    classpath "gradle.plugin.ru.pocketbyte.locolaser:plugin:1.0.4"
  }
}
```
In **`build.gradle`** of the module the plugin did applied:
```
// 1.3: Apply LocoLaser plugin
apply plugin: "ru.pocketbyte.locolaser"
```

##### 2 Step: Add 'localize' dependensy
Choose which tipe of artifact you will use and add them as **`localize`** dependency. This example uses artifact to work with Google Sheets:
```gradle
dependencies {
    // 2.1: Add dependency for mobile platform (mandatory for Android)
    localize 'ru.pocketbyte.locolaser:resource-mobile:2.0.0'
    // 2.2: Add dependency for Google Sheet
    localize 'ru.pocketbyte.locolaser:resource-googlesheet:2.0.0'
}
```
##### 3 Step: Run localization before build
This example run **`:localize`** task before each build.
<br>Modile **`build.gradle`**:
```gradle
afterEvaluate {
    preBuild.dependsOn project.tasks.localize
}
```
You can remove this code if you don't want to start localization before each build.
##### 4 Step: Create configuration file
By default project should have localization config file with name`"localize_config.json"` in the root folder of the module.
<br>This example has this file in the place. But you can change location of this file and it's name by following string:
```gradle
localize.config = "../another_module/another_name_of_config.json"
```
##### Plugin Tasks
LocoLaser plugin add tasks into **`localization`** group. You can run them manualy to run localization with different parameters.
